# spotifyrecommendedtiktok
React + NodeJS application that consumes the Spotify API. Purpose is to provide a more enjoyable experience for users to find new songs based off of songs they enjoy. This application guides the user through Spotify's OAuth, giving it access to the user's top songs, which it will use to seed Spotify's Recommended AI in order to gather a list of songs similar to the ones they enjoy the most. The application also uses the Intersection Observer API to change the audio track to the song that is being displayed on the screen. Uses a TikTok styled scrolling. It worked quite well, however it was abandoned because it felt quite hacky and I felt it would be much more sophisticated as a mobile app as TikTok styled scrolling is not as enjoyable or satisfying on the Web as on a mobile device. Perhaps now that I have an Apple device for developing on React Native that I can explore this option...
